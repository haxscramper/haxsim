* Lang

- [ ] Allow colored text in error reporting. Only make first line red
  (brief message).
- [ ] Pretty-printed exceptions for main entry point for compiler.
- [ ] Hash table implementation
- [ ] Linked list implementation
- [ ] Better pratt parser implementation that does not require to
  explicitly get infix expression inside parenthesis/braces.
- [ ] Output infix expression compilation into postfix notation
  - [ ] expression calculation
  - [ ] opcodes for ~if~/~for~ checks

- [ ] Use hlex base for lexer, provide more detailed messages about syntax
  errors.

* CPU emulation

- [ ] Conditionally enable logging after execution hits certain cell
  (opcode is fetched from ~0xFFFD~ for example). This can be used to debug
  execution of the certain code blocks instead of a whole thing at once.
