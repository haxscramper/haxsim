* Instruction decoding

- *FF* instructions are processed based on the runtime value of the ~MODRM~
  register, that is retrieved from the ~ModRM~ byte in the instruction
  encoding.

- ~ror ah, 1~ is encoded differently from ~ror ah, 2~ - first one is a ~d0
  cc~, and second one is ~c0 cc 03~


** Table description

- encoding :: description of the instruction encoding. contains
  comma-separated list of bytes that describe final arrangement in the
  binary encoding.
  - po :: Primary opcode
  - o :: Opcode extension, part of the =modrm= byte
  - op1/op2/op3/op4 :: Operands
